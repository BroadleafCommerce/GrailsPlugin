<p>
The Broadleaf Grails Plugin allows you run Broadleaf Commerce as a Grails Application.  
<a href="http://www.broadleafcommerce.org">Broadleaf Commerce</a> is an enterprise eCommerce framework built on Spring and JPA 2.0 / Hibernate.  Broadleaf Commerce is a highly customizable framework, and as such it allows a developer to extend the framework with additional domain objects, services, DAOs, workflows, and integrations.  Much of this is achieved via configuration. Broadleaf Commerce has a complex, custom merge process that allows an implementor to override or extend the Broadleaf Framework via Spring configuration files that are merged together with specific precedence to allow the implementor to swap out the default components of Broadleaf with custom components and domain classes.  Broadleaf Commerce typically recommends using Spring MVC. However the choice of UI is open to the implementor.

<p>
The Broadleaf Grails Plugin is a plugin that integrates Broadleaf's complex merge process within the context of the Grails conventions and lifecycles.

The Broadleaf Grails Plugin currently relies on Broadleaf Commerce version 1.7, Spring 3.1, <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/gorm-jpa">GORM JPA Plugin 1.0.0.M1</a>, and Grails 2.0.3.  This plugin will be published to the <a href="http://grails.org/plugins/">Grails Plugin Repository</a>.
